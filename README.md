# bash-bucket cli üåÄ
Bash Bucket is a command line interface to open repositories, branches, and pull requests in the default browswer for both [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/) and [Github](https://github.com/) with either [Mecurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) or [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as the version control system (VCS).

The purpose of bash-bucket is to efficiently open up current branch details through the terminal window:
- `$ bb` - open repo in browser
- `$ bb branch` - open current branch
- `$ bb commits` - open branch commit history
- `$ bb compare [branch]` - open and compare current branch to optional argument
- `$ bb issues` - go to issues in browser
- `$ bb info` - get branch and repo information about current directory
- `$ bb pr` - open a pull request from current branch
- `$ bb repo` - open repo in browser
